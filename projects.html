			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<h4>-N0raSoft-</h4>
			<h4>I want to found and create another small company again. Unlike the one i had before this one will be focused more on my own interests not money. I wanna work on software and hardware, but again for now just on my own and not for profit. Owning a company just for making profit is not really fun and stressful, i learned the hard way...</h4>

			<h4>-Floras Aero Place-</h4>
			<h4>I want to work on a website that probably will look and work the same as this one(maybe?). The point of that website being, a archive for frutiger aero media. So basically music, videos, wallpaper and more. Why? because i think there are not enough Frutiger aero archives yet. I wanna help preserving that era of our world. It will just be a little fun sideproject tho.</h4>

			<h4>-FluffyRetardz-</h4>
			<h4>Some of you might remember that, it´s my old Music brand. I used to make breakcore and dupstep music on there. I am working on getting my interest back in making music and play around a little. Since i still own all of my equipment.</h4>
