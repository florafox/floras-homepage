			<h3>Versions of Floras Homepage</h3>
			<p>This is version 6.0 of Floras Homepage!</p>
			<h4>This is the final version, there won't be any after this one.</h4>
			<h4>Yes it may look ugly to some, but it looks authentic. It is supposed to look like as if it was made in 2008.</h4>
			<h4>It might also not fully work on your smartphone, thats simply because back then there were no smartphones. So it will obviously not work properly</h4>
			<p>
			<h4>You don't like the current look of the Homepage?</h4>

			<h4>Floras Homepage started with version 1.0 launching in December 2022. Over the years it got updated and it evolved.</h4>
