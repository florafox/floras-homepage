			<h3>About</h3>
			<h4>Who am i?</h4>
			<p>My name is Flora and i currently live in Germany. My hobbies are playing video games, programming, webdesign reading and archiving meadia(physical and/or digital). I'm also a furry but i try to not make a big thing out of it, since i find people doing it weird. So just ignore that.</p>
			<h4>My biggest Interests?</h4>
			<p>Music is a pretty important one to me, since i listen to it 24/7. I like Michael jackson, Marilyn Manson, Limp Bizkit, MCR, and more. Basically Y2k music in general, Lapfox trax and halley labs. I also own a lot of tech from that era like laptop, flip phone, mp3 player, consoles and more. Safe to say i love to use older stuff, it got the charm modern tech and media could never achive.</p>
			<h4>Why am i such a big fan of the Y2k era?</h4>
			<p class="last">I simply grew up with 2000s tech and media. It feels nostalgic and kind of reminds me of times where i wouldn't have to worry about anything at all, just being able to play with my Nintendo DS all day or going outside playing with friends. I am also a nerd, so the technology from that era is a pretty cool thing to me. I also love to listen to my music on my discman from that era. Nowdays everythings boring, with everyone trying to simplify everything. Back then we had frutiger aero wich looked amazing in my opinion. Long story short, sure i am nostaglgic for this era, but for the most part it allows me to be who i really want to be, and how i really want to live.</p>
